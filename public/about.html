<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Cj — an up-and-coming freelance web developer with a passion for crafting clean, responsive, and meaningful digital experiences. I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology, where I built a strong foundation in coding, software design, and user-focused development.

From my first “Hello World” project to building fully functional websites and games, I’ve always been driven by the same spark — the thrill of turning ideas into interactive experiences. I specialize in front-end and full-stack web development, with growing expertise in frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express, as well as a love for experimenting with new technologies and creative design.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy developing indie game prototypes, exploring new UI ideas, and studying how design and psychology influence user interaction. My goal is to blend creativity and technical precision — to build digital products that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and impactful.

If you’re looking for a developer who brings passion, detail, and reliability to every project, I’d love to collaborate.

Let’s create something amazing together.</p>
